                <p>
                    The pale crag martin (Ptyonoprogne obsoleta) is a bird in the swallow family 
                    that is resident in northern Africa and in southwestern Asia. It breeds in 
                    mountains, other rocky areas and towns. It is 12-13 cm (4.5-5 in) long, with mainly
                     brown plumage, and paler below, with white "windows" on the tail that show as it 
                     hunts along cliffs for flying insects. It builds a deep bowl or quarter-sphere nest
                      on a flat surface, vertical rock face or wall, made with mud and lined with grass 
                      or feathers. It is normally a solitary breeder, but small groups may sometimes 
                      nest close together. The two or three eggs of a typical clutch are white with brown and 
                      grey blotches, and are incubated by both adults for 16-19 days prior to hatching. Both parents
                       then feed the chicks. Fledging takes another 22-24 days. With a large range and apparently 
                       increasing population, this species faces no major threats.

                       In Major League Baseball (MLB), the 50 home run club is the group of batters who have hit 
                       50 or more home runs in a single season. Babe Ruth (pictured) was the first to achieve this, 
                       doing so in 1920. By reaching the milestone, he also became the first player to hit 30 and 
                       then 40 home runs in a single-season, breaking his own record of 29 from the 1919 season. 
                       Ruth subsequently became the first player to reach the 50 home run club on four occasions, 
                       repeating the achievement in 1921, 1927 and 1928. He remained the only player to accomplish
                        this until Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa matched his feat in 1999 and 2001, respectively, 
                        thus becoming the only players to achieve four consecutive 50 home run seasons. Barry Bonds
                         hit the most home runs to join the club, collecting 73 in 2001. The most recent player to 
                         reach the milestone is Aaron Judge, achieving the feat for the second time during the 2022 season.
                          In total, 30 players have reached the 50 home run club in MLB history.
